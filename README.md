# Basalt

Basalt is an open-source programming language designed for coding in the Minecraft server DiamondFire.
It replaces the server's block coding system with an intuitive textual representation that greatly improves the productivity of developers.

**Basalt relies on the CodeClient API to send compiled templates to Minecraft, so until CodeClient is updated to 1.21.11, Basalt is basically unusable, lol.**
